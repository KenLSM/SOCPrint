Overview

Our project aims to make the printing service at School of Computing (SoC) simpler and easier. (refer to https://docs.comp.nus.edu.sg/services to find out more about SoC’s printing service) We plan to develop a website such that SoC students can perform most of printing related tasks here. Our project is targeting Project Gemini.

Ideation

For our 1-minute pitch during Ignition, refer to https://youtu.be/osQjStOAci0?t=2h29m26s

Our project’s target audience is SoC students. We have been wondering why we can’t make SoC printing experience much simpler and easier. Current problems include 1) need to set up every printer in SoC, 2) inconvenient UNIX commands to view remaining quota (page allowance for students), see print queue in each printer, and delete print jobs in printer. To put it simple, the problem is that the current SoC printing service is too troublesome for lazy people like us. We make it simpler and easier.

User Stories

As an SOC student having some lecture notes to print, I want to print them without installing anything, straight from the browser itself.
As an SOC student, I want to find out if there are any documents that are currently printing or is in queue from a printer.
As an SOC student, I want to find out my print quota in my account.
Planned Features

Features already implemented

We have implemented a basic SSH communication between our server and SoC’s Sunfire UNIX server which handles printing jobs. please refer to

Prototype website: http://52.74.219.251/

In addition, we have also implemented Sunfire account login, Select printer, Select file, and View printer queues.

Features planned to be implemented for June sprint

We are planning to implement following features before next milestone

With regard to printing: upload file to server, convert PDF into PS, print on Sunfire
With regard to web presentation: hide login credentials after login, show print quota, show more print queues, window overlay for print uploading
With regard to design: refer to the design sketch:
